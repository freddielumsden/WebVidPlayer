# WebVidPlayer
I WANT TO CREATE:
A web video player
Which can take Video from ANYWHERE! You could have it playing in a different tab, you could have it stored as a file, maybe even torrents in future
To take that video, if it is in a different application or different site, you can easily screen grab it which is intuitive and easy
Then you can add subtitles to your video, which is also simple. You can change how these subtitles look, which gives you the ability to change opacity to hide other subtitles behind it in a dfferent language, for example
You can take a screenshot of the video at any point, and you can also record for example the last ten seconds of audio (potentially without having to rewind the video for the user to record). This can then be sent to anki or whatevs.
